            The ACReSAL interventions in Sokoto State are set to significantly enhance land use planning, restore degraded land, and boost food productivity.

            ACReSAL will place a strong emphasis on the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups in Sokoto State, including women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, internally displaced people, and ethnic and religious minorities. Farmers and host communities within affected local government, especially Wurno, Dange Shuni Tureta and Bodinga Local Government areas of Sokoto will greatly benefit from the projectâ€™s initiatives.

      The project aims to ensure that these groups are fully involved in the community-level structures established or supported by ACReSAL. Additionally, government institutions at both the federal and state levels, along with partners from various governmental and non-governmental organizations, will benefit from the institutional modernization and policy support provided by the project.
